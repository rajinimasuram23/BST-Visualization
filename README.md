# BST-Visualization
This is a simple C++ program,which creates and displays the binary search tree upon entering it’s elements.
This program needs graphics and hence can be run in Turbo C/C++ .

The main features of this project are listed below.
1. Entering elements : The user enters the elements with which the BST has to be
constructed.
2. Inserting an element : The user can insert an element and the tree is reconstructed.
3. Deleting element : Any element can be deleted from the tree to get the new tree.
4. Searching an element : The user can search for an element in the tree.
This program visualizes a binary search tree and it’s construction when elements are inserted
or deleted. It hence enables a better understanding of the concept of BST.
